# Project 1: Regression Machine Learning

* My project will consist of two machine learning algorithms.  The first algorithm utilizes linear regression to predict the overall rating of burritos using a highly correlated variable of non-meat fillings.  The second algorithm utilizes logistic regression to predict a binary classification variable.  Factoring in all 10 core dimensions that the burritos are evaluated on, the model will predict whether or not the reviewers will recommend it or not recommend it.
